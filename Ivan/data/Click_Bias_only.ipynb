       "      <th>Sarah Huckabee Sanders is a well-paid liar. Day after day, she takes to the White House Press Briefing Room to defend whatever ridiculous thing Trump has done most recently. She’s achieved infamy through her brazen willingness to state literally any absurdity with a straight face.\\n\\nToday, Sanders faced tough questions regarding the Trump/Russia scandal and ongoing investigation. After tensely attempting to change the subject several times, she finally let reporters know how she really felt.\\n\\nWhen questioned about Trump’s tweet regarding the lost FBI text messages, she told reporters exasperatedly, “You guys are obsessed with collusion!” Well, yeah, Sarah. Trump’s criminal behavior matters an awful lot, considering his occupancy of the Oval Office.\\n\\nI think he thinks there is great cause for concern that five months worth of text messages have gone missing, particularly given the individual as part of that process has already been shown to be extremely biased against the president, and was involved it what seems to be some very inappropriate behavior, and that certainly is of great concern. You guys are absolutely obsessed with everything to do with collusion, if it has anything to do with the president. We hope that you’ll take some of that same obsession, energy, and furor and direct it to some of the places it looks like there could have been some really inappropriate and possibly illegal behavior.\\n\\nHere’s the video:\\n\\nTrump’s tweet was referring to an FBI agent who had an affair with a lawyer who worked for the FBI. Texts between the two showed anti-Trump bias, so he was immediately fired from the Mueller investigation. It’s notable that it’s perfectly fine for citizens to hold personal beliefs—there has been absolutely no evidence of bias on the job or wrongdoing. He was fired to prevent it from even being remotely possible. Robert Mueller himself is a lifelong Republican. The texts that were lost, that Trump feels are so important, are five months of sexts as part of an affair.\\n\\nObviously the press is obsessed with collusion. Where there is smoke, there is fire, and although dozens of connections between Trump’s campaign and Russia have been reported, the “fire” in question is going to be private financial information that only official investigations will be able to acquire. These things take time, as does building and prosecuting a case. Manafort has still not even been tried, for example—this is far from over.\\n\\nNot only that, but Trump gets dirtier by the day. There’s a good chance the payment he reportedly gave Stormy Daniels could have been illegal. The FBI texts only matter to right-wing press that has no goal other than to vindicate Trump. Sanders and conservatives care absolutely nothing for objective truth or justice. They have no motive beyond enabling Trump and his criminal behavior.\\n\\nFeatured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</th>\n",

Neale is an ally of Vice President Mike Pence and was appointed to his role in the Medicaid program in March. He was the healthcare policy director under Pence back when Pence was the governor of Indiana (their relationship goes back even further than that), and he helped design Indiana’s Medicaid expansion.\\n\\nIn his role as a Medicaid official in the federal government, he was a key factor in bringing about the work requirements that states are now allowed to require. With that goal accomplished, he’s now stepping down. It’s not too clear why, and no reasons have been stated, but it’s likely that he wanted a key accomplishment under his belt before leaving the raging dumpster fire that is the Trump administration.\\n\\n“A year and then I’m out” has been a common mantra among high level Trump appointees—with exceptions. Some, like Stephen Miller, appear to be in it for the long haul. Others have not made it anywhere near a year. In any case, the Trump administration has bled staff at a historically high rate.\\n\\nAccording to an internal staff memo obtained by Inside Health Policy,\\n\\n‘Neale, a closely ally of Vice President Mike Pence, spent a year helping to craft the Trump administration’s new policy direction on Medicaid, and reasons for his departure remain unclear. “Next month, Brian will be leaving CMS to pursue other opportunities,” CMS Administrator Seema Verma wrote in the email to CMS staff Tuesday.’\\n\\nHe joins with many other high level Trump appointees who have left the administration.\\n\\nFeatured image via Mike Theiler-Pool/Getty Images</th>\n",

Anan’s arrest comes just days after he announced plans to challenge el-Sisi for the presidency in a vote scheduled for March.\\n\\n“There is no legal basis to arrest him,” Refaat said, calling the move politically motivated.\\n\\nThe cops didn’t just throw Anan in jail.

Ted Lieu (D-CA) is encouraging marchers to make their voices heard in light of the government shutdown precipitated by Trump’s refusal to extend DACA protections to Dreamers brought into the United States as children and to sign funding for CHIP, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which expired months ago and has yet to be addressed by the president or a GOP Congress.\\n\\nMarchers across the country plan to do just that.\\n\\nThe theme of this year’s march, Power to the Polls, focuses more on organizing than the public outrage that erupted over the election of a president accused by multiple women of sexual assault and sexual harassment, a president who promised to ban Muslims and punish women who exercise their right to make private medical decisions with their doctors. Instead of anger, the theme is power and taking it back, the result of a year’s worth of pushing back and rising to the fore for women who want a seat at the political table.\\n\\nTIME's new cover: First they marched. Now a record number of women are running for office https://t.co/7Gh9sb1zbu pic.twitter.com/xeu0c5SPL6 — TIME (@TIME) January 18, 2018\\n\\nAs TIME magazine’s Charlotte Adler wrote:\\n\\n‘In dozens of interviews with TIME, progressive women described undergoing a metamorphosis. In 2016, they were ordinary voters. In 2017, they became activists, spurred by the bitter defeat of the first major female presidential candidate at the hands of a self-described pussy grabber. Now, in 2018, these doctors and mothers and teachers and executives are jumping into the arena and bring new energy to a Democratic Party sorely in need of fresh faces.’\\n\\nThe Women’s March 2018 taking place across the country is a direct response to the failed leadership of Donald Trump and his tendency to place the bigotry of his supporters over the good of a country. Voters have already begun to answer his failures with ballots, turning red states like Alabama blue and flipping seats in Congress. However, the change isn’t just taking place in federal governments, but state and local governments, as well, where Democrats – and specifically Democratic women, more specifically minority Democratic women – are showing up to run for office in greater numbers than ever before.\\n\\nThe Women's March returns this weekend with marches, rallies, and The Women's March Anniversary: Power to the Polls https://t.co/SAJ7H0j69u pic.twitter.com/ymtDaq2iMH — BrooklynVegan (@brooklynvegan) January 19, 2018\\n\\nAccording to The Cut:\\n\\n‘To date, 390 women are planning to run for the House of Representatives, a figure that’s higher than at any point in American history. Twenty-two of them are non-incumbent black women — for scale, there are only 18 black women in the House right now. Meanwhile, 49 women are likely to be running for the Senate, more than 68 percent higher than the number who’d announced at the same point in 2014.’\\n\\nThe marches will continue on Sunday, the anniversary of the protests of Trump’s inauguration. Lawmakers, celebrities, and performers will help to mark the event.\\n\\nOn January 21, 2018, the anniversary of the @WomensMarch, we will gather in Las Vegas to show that women are not backing down; we are bringing the power of our movement to the polls.

Oddly silent, the president never mentioned nor even attempted to spin the explosive revelations on Twitter. Instead he focused on spinning more evidence of the booming economy he’s created.\\n\\nAccording to news reports, Mueller has now interviewed a key member of Trump’s inner circle, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Further interviews were conducted with former FBI Director James Comey and former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. An even bigger bombshell was dropped when reports revealed that Mueller is also interested in questions around the day Trump summoned former Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe to the Oval Office to ask him who he voted for in 2016. These are all massively consequential revelations, but Trump has had nothing to say about any of them.\\n\\nEven more odd, not to mention heartless, is Trump’s failure to acknowledge the eleventh school shooting of 2018 (11 school shootings in 23 days) in Marshall County, Kentucky. Two were killed and several more injured, but the president has had nothing to say about the tragedy. Perhaps he believes the country no longer needs a president who acknowledges real issues as long as he can convince everyone they’re going to get rich any day now.\\n\\nTwitter was not impressed with Trump’s bragging and turned his misleading tweet on its head with some statistics and news stories of their own.

       "      <th>Tuesday brought an endless stream of new revelations in the Mueller investigation of Donald Trump’s alleged obstruction of justice and his campaign’s alleged collusion with Russian government operatives. Witness interviews included even members of the president’s most inner circle, as well as interviews of witnesses to the acts that to even the most untrained eye appear to constitute obstruction by the president.\\n\\nIn the latest news of a string of witnesses to have been interviewed comes former CIA Director Mike Pompeo as well as former acting Attorney General Sally Yates.\\n\\nThe country watched with growing alarm as Yates testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2017, but her cooperation in the Mueller probe was kept under wraps until now. Yates was the first to sound the alarm to Donald Trump’s administration about the potential compromise they faced with Michael Flynn serving as a national security adviser.\\n\\nYates went to White House counsel Don McGahn on January 26, 2017 to warn that the Russian government had blackmail power over Flynn, yet Flynn was not fired until February 13. In the nearly three weeks between Yates’ warning and Flynn’s firings, McGahn took the allegations that Flynn may have even committed crimes seriously enough to begin researching those acts and their legal consequences.\\n\\n‘The White House turned over records this fall to special counsel Robert Mueller revealing that in the very first days of the Trump presidency, Don McGahn researched federal law dealing both with lying to federal investigators and with violations of the Logan Act, a centuries-old federal law that prohibits private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments, according to three people with direct knowledge of the confidential government documents.’\\n\\nWhile it may have taken nearly three weeks for Flynn’s crimes to be addressed by the White House by firing him, it only took five days for Yates herself to be fired after warning McGahn about Flynn. All of these details are of special interest to Robert Mueller and his investigators, and Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI upon being indicted for the crime.\\n\\nA second interview also provides insight into the direction of the Mueller investigation. Former CIA Director Mike Pompeo was both a “peripheral witness” to the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, who was pressured by Trump to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn. Pompeo himself was also “leaned on by Trump” to pressure Comey to drop the investigation, making him a key witness in the probe of Trump’s alleged obstruction of justice.\\n\\n‘Flynn’s tenure in the White House and his firing by Trump are among the topics Mueller’s team has been asking witnesses to discuss, and they are likely to be part of any questioning of the president. Separately, Mueller is expected to want to ask Trump about his firing of Comey. The president told NBC News last year that his decision was connected to Comey’s dogged pursuit of potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump has repeatedly called the investigation a “hoax” and a “witch-hunt.”‘\\n\\nMueller is expected to begin laying the groundwork to question the president in the coming weeks.\\n\\nFeatured image via Getty/The Asahi Shimbun</th>\n",

       "      <th>s the Potemkin Village walls of The Left's 'Trump Collusion' narrative crash and burn along with special counsel Mueller's credibility, The New York Post's Michael Goodwin sees far more wide-ranging problems ahead for America's 'intelligence' agencies as the anti-Trump 'secret society' and lovers-texts-gate debacles threaten the core of the Deep State.\\n\\nGoodwin writes that, during the financial crisis, the federal government bailed out banks it declared “too big to fail.” Fearing their bankruptcy might trigger economic Armageddon, the feds propped them up with taxpayer cash.\\n\\nSomething similar is happening now at the FBI, with the Washington wagons circling the agency to protect it from charges of corruption. This time, the appropriate tag line is “too big to believe.”\\n\\nYet each day brings credible reports suggesting there is a massive scandal involving the top ranks of America’s premier law enforcement agency. The reports, which feature talk among agents of a “secret society” and suddenly missing text messages, point to the existence both of a cabal dedicated to defeating Donald Trump in 2016 and of a plan to let Hillary Clinton skate free in the classified email probe.\\n\\nIf either one is true — and I believe both probably are — it would mean FBI leaders betrayed the nation by abusing their powers in a bid to pick the president.\\n\\nMore support for this view involves the FBI’s use of the Russian dossier on Trump that was paid for by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. It is almost certain that the FBI used the dossier to get FISA court warrants to spy on Trump associates, meaning it used the opposition research of the party in power to convince a court to let it spy on the candidate of the other party — likely without telling the court of the dossier’s political link.\\n\\nEven worse, there is growing reason to believe someone in President Barack Obama’s administration turned over classified information about Trump to the Clinton campaign.\\n\\nAs one former federal prosecutor put it, “It doesn’t get worse than that.” That prosecutor, Joseph ­diGenova, believes Trump was correct when he claimed Obama aides wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower.\\n\\nThese and other elements combine to make a toxic brew that smells to high heaven, but most Americans don’t know much about it. Mainstream media coverage has been sparse and dismissive and there’s a blackout from the same Democrats obsessed with Russia, Russia, Russia.\\n\\nPartisan motives aside, it’s as if a scandal of this magnitude is more than America can bear — so let’s pretend there’s nothing to see and move along.\\n\\nBut, thankfully the disgraceful episode won’t be washed away, thanks to a handful of congressional Republicans, led by California Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House’s Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. After he accused the FBI of stonewalling in turning over records, the bureau relented, at least partially.\\n\\nThe result was clear evidence of bias against Trump by officials charged with investigating him and Clinton. Those same agents appear to have acted on that bias to tilt the election to Clinton.\\n\\nIn one text message, an agent suggests that Attorney General Loretta Lynch knew while the investigation was still going on that the FBI would not recommend charges against Clinton.\\n\\nHow could she know unless the fix was in?\\n\\nAll roads in the explosive developments lead to James Comey, whose Boy Scout image belied a sinister belief that he, like his infamous predecessor J. Edgar Hoover, was above the law.\\n\\nIt is why I named him J. Edgar Comey last year and wrote that he was “adept at using innuendo and leaks” to let everybody in Washington know they could be the next to be investigated.\\n\\nIt was in the office of Comey’s top deputy, Andrew McCabe, where agents discussed an “insurance policy” in the event that Trump won. Reports indicated that the Russia-collusion probe was that insurance policy.\\n\\nThe text was from Peter Strzok, the top investigator on the Trump case, and was sent to Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer and also his mistress.\\n\\n“I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office — that there’s no way he gets elected — but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk. It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40 . . . ” Strzok wrote.\\n\\nIt is frightening that Strzok, who called Trump “an idiot,” was the lead investigator on both the Clinton and Trump cases.\\n\\nAfter these messages surfaced, special counsel Robert Mueller removed Strzok and Page from his probe, though both still work at the FBI.\\n\\nStrzok, despite his talk of an “insurance policy” in 2016, wrote in May of 2017 that he was skeptical Mueller’s probe would find anything on Trump because “there’s no big there there.”\\n\\nTalk about irony. While Dems and the left-wing media already found Trump guilty of collusion before Mueller was appointed, the real scandal might be the conduct of the probers themselves.\\n\\nSuspicions are hardly allayed by the fact that the FBI says it can’t find five months of messages between Strzok and Page, who exchanged an estimated 50,000 messages overall. The missing period — Dec. 14, 2016 through May 17, 2017 — was a crucial time in Washington.\\n\\nThere were numerous leaks of classified material just before and after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.\\n\\nAnd the president fired Comey last May 9, provoking an intense lobbying effort for a special counsel, which led to Mueller’s appointment on May 19.\\n\\nJeff Sessions, the attorney general, has emerged from his hidey hole to notice that the FBI has run amok, and said Monday he would “leave no stone unturned” to find the five months of missing texts.\\n\\nFine, but the House is racing ahead of him. Nunes has prepared a four-page memo, based on classified material that purportedly lays out what the FBI and others did to corrupt the election.\\n\\nA movement to release the memo is gaining steam, but Congress says it might take weeks. Why wait? Americans can handle the truth, no matter how big it is.</th>\n",
